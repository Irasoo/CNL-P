Input: Develop a Solidity smart contract for a blockchain messenger that saves messages on the blockchain. The messages should be readable by everyone, writable only by the contract deployer, and should count how many times the message was updated.

Steps:
1. Design the smart contract structure to include a public message variable and a counter for updates.
2. Implement a function to update the message, ensuring only the deployer can execute it.
3. Implement a function to retrieve the current message and the update count.
4. Ensure the contract is optimized for gas efficiency and security.
5. Provide explanations for each part of the code to clarify the implementation.

Expectation: A complete Solidity smart contract code with explanations for each function and design choice.

Those are the ones who have been true, and it is those who are the righteous.' (Arabic: لَيْسَ الْبِرَّ أَن تُوَلُّوا وُجُوهَكُمْ قِبَلَ الْمَشْرِقِ وَالْمَغْرِبِ وَلَـٰكِنَّ الْبِرَّ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ وَالْكِتَابِ وَالنَّبِيِّينَ وَآتَى الْمَالَ عَلَىٰ حُبِّهِ ذَوِي الْقُرْبَىٰ وَالْيَتَامَىٰ وَالْمَسَاكِينَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيلِ وَالسَّائِلِينَ وَفِي الرِّقَابِ وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَاةَ وَآتَى الزَّكَاةَ وَالْمُوفُونَ بِعَهْدِهِمْ إِذَا عَاهَدُوا وَالصَّابِرِينَ فِي الْبَأْسَاءِ وَالضَّرَّاءِ وَحِينَ الْبَأْسِ ۗ أُولَـٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَأُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُتَّقُونَ).""
