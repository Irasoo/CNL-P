While both sentences mention a guy, the context and details are different.

Sentence 1 describes a ""very dirty man"" sleeping on the step of a building, implying a sense of dishevelment and neglect.

Sentence 2 describes a ""drunk man"" who has ""passed out next to a puddle of vomit"" in front of a building, which is an even more vivid and disturbing image.
