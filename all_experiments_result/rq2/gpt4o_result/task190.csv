Explanation: While both sentences describe a similar scene involving people in shorts and hiking gear standing in the snow near a sign that says ""Danger,"" there are differences in the details. Sentence 1 mentions ""Two men and a woman"" and a ""large green sign with a smaller sign saying 'Danger' on top,"" whereas Sentence 2 mentions ""Two people"" and a ""sign declaring 'Danger'."" The differences in the number of people and the description of the sign make it unclear if they are describing the exact same scene, leading to a neutral relationship.",0
