Sentence 1: A very dirty man is sleeping on the step of a building.  
Sentence 2: A drunk man has passed out next to a puddle of vomit in front of a building.

The relationship between these sentences can be analyzed as follows:

- Both sentences describe a man in a state of unconsciousness or sleep near a building.
- Sentence 1 describes the man as ""very dirty"" and ""sleeping,"" while Sentence 2 describes him as ""drunk"" and ""passed out next to a puddle of vomit.""
- The descriptions of the man's condition (dirty vs. drunk) and the specific circumstances (sleeping vs. passed out next to vomit) suggest that while they may refer to similar situations, they do not necessarily imply one another.
